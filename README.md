# intro_to_pandas

- Pandas is a library providing data structures and data analysis code
- it allows you to load data from different sources into python and then use python code to analyze the data and produce results
- These results can be in the form of tables, text, and also visualizations with the help of visualization libraries such as Bokeh


## Installing Pandas
- you can install pandas with pip3
- pip3.9 install pandas

## Installing an enhanced Python shell called IPython
- ipython provides better printing for large text.
- this ability makes ipython suitable for data analysis because the program prints data in a well-structured format.
- pip3.9 install ipython

## Installing Jupyter Notebook
- Jupyter Notebook is a third party library
- install: pip3.9 install jupyter
- starting Jupyter:
  - from command line: jupyter notebook
  - if the above command does not work:
    - Mac: python3.9 -m jupyter notebook
    - Windows: py -3.9 -m jupyter notebook
  - if it works, you will see a Jupyter Notebook opened in your default browser
- it is a great environment to explore data and data analysis with python
